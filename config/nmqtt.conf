# The verbosity level handles the stderr-output.
# Level `1`
#  - This will print when a client connects and disconnect.
# Level `2`
#  - This will print level 1 information and packet data.
# Level `3`
#  - This will print level 1 and 2 information and detailed data on each client
#    and the broker. This will reveal clients password, so it should NOT be
#    used in production.

# To activate a SSL connection you need a certificate and a private key.
# When you specify both of them, the connection will automatic be using
# SSL. It is common practice to change the port you a listening on from
# 1883 to 8883, when using SSL.
#
# You have to specify the absolute path to both the certificate and the key.
#
# If you dont have a certificate and key, you can generate them with:
# `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout mykey.pem -out mycert.pem`
